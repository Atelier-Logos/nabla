# 🧭 Code of Conduct

## 🌈 Our Vibe

We’re building a community that’s open, curious, irreverent, and human. We value dark jokes, wild ideas, passionate debates, memes that toe the line—and we also deeply respect each other’s boundaries. If someone says “hey, that wasn’t cool” or “I’m not comfortable with this,” we listen. No drama, no ego. We stop, recalibrate, and move forward with care.

This space is meant to foster creativity, camaraderie, and chaos *without cruelty*.

## 🪩 What We Value

- Humor that punches up, not down  
- Memes, shitposts, weirdness—shared in good faith  
- Open discussions that encourage learning, even if messy  
- Expressing hurt or discomfort without fear of ridicule  
- Giving people the benefit of the doubt  
- Calling each other in, not out  
- Apologizing when we mess up—and being allowed to move on  

## 🚫 What Crosses the Line

We don’t ban specific types of jokes—but we do care how people feel. If something harms, demeans, or excludes others, it’s not cool here.

Some examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, stalking, or doxxing  
- Jokes that rely on racism, transphobia, misogyny, or other forms of oppression  
- Ignoring or mocking someone’s request to stop  
- Cruelty masked as “just joking”  
- Repeatedly crossing lines after being asked not to  
- Publishing private information without consent  

If you hurt someone—even accidentally—you’re expected to stop and reflect. No one’s perfect, and no one gets exiled for a bad joke if they’re willing to listen and grow.

## 🧭 When Conflict Happens

We *want* healthy disagreement. Banter and debate are part of the culture here. But:

- If someone says they’re uncomfortable or hurt, **we pause the bit.**
- If someone asks you to stop—**stop.**
- If you're unsure, just ask: _“Too far?”_  

We are a community that believes people can learn and do better. Mistakes are okay. Refusing to listen is not.

## 🛟 How We Handle Issues

If something’s bothering you, you can:

1. Say something in the moment (if you feel safe to).
2. Message a mod or maintainer privately.
3. Email [YOUR_EMAIL_HERE] to report serious issues.

All reports will be taken seriously. We won’t over-police, but we *will* intervene when someone is being harmed or ignored. When needed, we may mute, remove, or block participants, temporarily or permanently.

We will always prioritize the safety and well-being of the person harmed.

## 📍Where This Applies

These expectations apply across all community spaces: issues, pull requests, comments, DMs (if related to project matters), community chat, events, and memes posted under our banner.

You’re still a representative of the project even when you’re being goofy.

## 🫂 Final Word

We are not a “professional” space—we’re a passionate, creative, weird one. We believe in **freedom with accountability**, **fun with compassion**, and the idea that you can be edgy without being an asshole.

**Remember the human. Bring the memes. Respect the stop signs.**
